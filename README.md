## Overview
+   When our team had the chance to dive into some independent learning of new technologies and build something creative we chose. We focused on react's built in `context api` for state management and `functional programming principles` to build a UI to allow Phish fans to find and play any live Phish audio stream.
+   Gone_Phishin allows a user to:
  - Browse by year.
  - Browse by show.
  - See a list of all tracks broken down by set.
  - Click on and listen to any track.
  - Use a years drop down from the years or tracks display to be taken to the the years page to switch up the shows data.
  - Bookmark favorite shows or type in a url path to navigate the application
  - Enter Party Mode and watch the page change in front of you to a more party friendly style. 🤪 🎉 🎛️
  - See a user-friendly error display (also available in party mode!)

## Set-up Instructions
  + Fork this repo by clicking the ```Fork``` button in the upper right of this page
  + Clone your new repo down to your local machine in your chosen directory
  + Type ```npm install``` into the command line to install all dependencies
  + Type ```npm start``` into to the command line to start the React app. A browser window will appear running a local host url

## Learning Goals
+ Our team learned several new technologies in the course of a week including React's context API and React hooks.
  - We chose to use `React's Context API` to manage our application state. which allowed us to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
  - As the application grows, context will help our application stay organized and easy to read and manage as we start to use and manipulate shared state values from multiple components.  
  - Currently our application takes advantage of a party mode context called `ThemeContext` which allows multiple components to listen for state changes as party mode is toggled on and off, changing component styling.
  - Take a look at any page display and choose the toggle theme button to see how state (theme, isPartyMode) is shared between components.
  - We also have a context that holds show data that is shared amongst our components, including our all shows and all tracks data. Note: In the future as more functionality is added, more components will need access to this state. 
+ We also used `React Hooks` in our application which allowed us to use state without relying on a class component. We were able to 'hook into' React state and lifecycle features and work with advanced hooks like `useContext`.
+ We are currently collaborating with Phish.in and hoping to merge our mobile version of the application so that Phish fans have a mobile friendly of the desktop application.

## Future Features
+ We hope to add more search option functionality, including search by venues, and by song.
+ We would like to add a reducer as opposed to state and integrate that with our showContext.

### Wins and Challenges
+ Wins:
  - We enjoyed working as a team and were able to learn several new technologies in just 11 days while imagining and building a really cool application that exceeded our learning goals.
  - We were able to collaborate with the creators of our server side code and kept them in mind when designing our application as they were looking for a responsive mobile view of their UI.
+ Challenges:
  - We ran into troubles trying to implement reducers on our first go when we learned that useReducer doesn't support async actions natively. We plan to incorporate a reducer to clean up or state management in the future by going with a different approach to our reducer actions.
